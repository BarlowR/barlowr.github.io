## Application of the Integrated Speed to Fly Model
2025-01-05

Let's look at a few examples of application of the system described in [Balancing Speed to Fly and Risk Tolerance](/content/projects/Flying_Better/Balancing_Speed_to_Fly_&_Risk_Tolerance/Balancing_Speed_to_Fly_&_Risk_Tolerance) for three different pilots. 
## Pilot 1
Traits: 
* Just starting to use full range of their speed bar 
* Have done a few XC flights on really good days
* Starting to fly in lower level competitions
* Uses the basic model.

Risk Tolerance:
* Learning what situations can hold real danger and which are more benign. Appropriately errs on the side of caution.
* Wants to stay as high as possible on any given flight, but apply speedbar appropriately. 
* Has an altitude threshold at 1500' AGL. 

Situation 1.A:
* Pilot 1 topped out a thermal 3000' above terrain at a local mountain ridge site and has transitioned away from the turbulence of the climb onto glide.
* The thermal had a max climb rate of 3m/s. The pilot chose to stay in the thermal until it petered out at TOL. The pilot took time to center the climb, so over the full thermal the average climb rate was 1m/s
* Pilot 1 knows common triggers along their planned course line at the site.

Decision making process for Situation 1.A: 
* Pilot 1 is above their altitude threshold.
* Pilot 1 recognizes that there is no technical or tactical risk in their current situation
* **Decision**: Racing Mode
	* Pilot 1 choses to fly in Racing Mode at MC 1, appropriately applying 1/3 speedbar.

 Situation 1.B:
 * Pilot 1 is at 1250' AGL on glide and comes across a weak climb. 

Decision making process for Situation 1.B: 
* Pilot 1 is below their altitude threshold.
* **Decision**: Risk Minimization Mode
	* Pilot 1 choses to take the climb given that they are below their altitude threshold. Pilot 1 begins to look for better triggers or climb indicators to go to after climbing above their altitude threshold. 

Situation 1.C:
 * Pilot 1 is flying at 2500' AGL, flying in "Racing Mode". 
 * Pilot 1 is approaching a transition from one mountain range to another, across a large valley through a headwind. 

Decision making process for Situation 1.C: 
* Pilot 1 recognizes that despite being above their altitude threshold, the transition to the range presents a significant tactical risk. 
* **Decision**: Risk Minimization Mode
	* Pilot 1 switches to "Risk Minimization" mode. They slow down to trim speed and search all triggers for climbs. They take any climbs they find as high as possible before going on glide. Even though they are flying at MC 0 across the transition, they adjust their speed based on the headwind.

## Pilot 2
Traits: 
* Strong thermalling skills.
* Comfortable using full range of their speed bar.
* Has done long XC flights, both straight line and triangle.
* Comfortable flying in mid level competitions. 

Pilot 2's Risk Tolerance:
* Feels comfortable assessing both tactical and technical risk in any given situation.
* Values flying fast to make XC distance over altitude.
* Sets an altitude threshold of 1000'.
* Uses the advanced model.

Situation 2.A:
* Pilot 2 topped out a thermal 800' above terrain at a local mountain ridge site and has transitioned away from the turbulence of the climb onto glide.
* The thermal had a max climb rate of 3m/s. The pilot left the climb when the average climb rate dropped below 2 m/s. From first turn into the climb to leaving, the average climb rate was 2m/s
* Pilot 1 knows common triggers along their planned course line at the site, and is flying directly above the ridge.

Decision making process for Situation 2.A: 
* Pilot 2 recognizes that they are below their altitude threshold. However, they recognize that they have safe glide out to the valley floor which puts them above their altitude threshold.
* Pilot 2 knows that the upcoming triggers are likely to work and that they are flying on a lift-y line. 
* **Decision**: Racing Mode
	* Pilot 2 flies in "Racing Mode" at MC 2. They don't stop for any climbs along the ridge less than 2 m/s. They maintain appropriate terrain clearance. If they start to fall off the ridge, they drop their MC number, flying slower and accepting weaker climbs. 

Situation 2.B:
* Pilot 2 is approaching a thermal trigger that is known for being rowdy. 
* Pilot 2 is 600' above terrain along a ridge. 

Decision making process for Situation 2.B: 
* Pilot 2 has safe glide out to the valley floor, which puts them above their altitude threshold.
* Pilot 2 recognizes that they don't want to fight the rowdy thermal close to terrain. 
* **Decision**: Risk Minimization Mode
	* They switch into "Risk Minimization" mode and take a light climb at 1m/s until they feel they have safe altitude. They then head to the rowdy thermal trigger and fight the climb to the top at 4m/s.

Situation 2.C:
* Pilot 2 is in the middle of a gaggle of pilots getting close to goal in a flatland competition. 
* Pilot 2 has been flying in "Racing Mode" at MC 3 along a cloud street.
* The goal cylinder is at a 45 degree angle off the cloud street under blue sky ahead. 
* Pilot 2 has a comfortable point buffer for their desired finish position in the competition.

Decision making process for Situation 2.C: 
* Pilot 3 decides that the risk of landing out is not worth the extra point gain from arriving in the front of the gaggle. 
*  **Decision**: Risk Minimization Mode
	* The pilot tanks up along the cloud street, and only begins the glide to goal when they are sure they have enough altitude buffer to deal with sink or headwind along the way.

Situation 2.D:
* Same as situation 2.C, except:
	* Pilot 2 values winning the competition very highly.
	* Pilot 2 is in a tight points race for the win.

Decision making process for Situation 2.D: 
* Pilot 3 decides that the risk of landing out is worth the extra point gain from arriving in the front of the gaggle. 
*  **Decision**: Racing Mode
	* Pilot 2 leaves the cloud street above and behind the first few pilots who peel off towards goal. Pilot 2 modulates speedbar in lift and sink to gain altitude on this final glide. Pilot 2 uses environmental clues to fly the best line to goal. The risk of bombing out is much higher, but so is the chance of coming into goal first.
