## The Insight of MacCready Speed to Fly
2024-12-28

# Introduction

Dr. Paul MacCready was a prolific aeronautical engineer, known for [winning the Kremer prize for human powered aircaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacCready_Gossamer_Condor), wining the US sailplane nationals in 1948, 1949, and 1953, and starting the UAS company [Aerovironment](https://www.avinc.com/). MacReady speed to fly theory, invented by and named after Dr. MacCready, is a concept one may come across in any soaring sport (sailplanes, paragliders, etc). 

MacCready theory seeks to answer a simple question: When a pilot is at the top of a thermal in a non-powered aircraft, how fast should the pilot fly to the next thermal?

As non-powered aircraft fly faster, their sink rate drops off non-linearly. One way to think of this is that glide ratio, the distance flown horizontally divided by the altitude lost, decreases with additional speed. For example, on a EN-B paraglider, one may fly at 10:1 at 38km/h (trim), but this drops non-linearly to ~7:1 at ~52km/h (full speed bar). 

The bounding of the MacCready problem is relatively simple- knowing this relationship for a glider and the strength of the next climb the pilot will take, minimize the sum of the time spent gliding and the time spend climbing by optimizing the speed that the pilot will fly between thermals. 

MacCready speed to fly is often represented directly as a MacCready (MC) value. This value corresponds to the expected strength of the next climb. For example, "Flying MC 4" means flying MacCready speed to fly for an expected next climb of 4 m/s.

# MacCready Speed to Fly Solution Derivation

The solution for optimal MacCready speed to fly is a function of the strength of the next expected climb. (Note: It's also a function of wind the pilot is flying in and the current sink rate, but we'll leave those aside for now). For a mathematical derivation, see the page on [MacCready Derivation](/content/projects/Flying_Better/MacCready_Speed_to_Fly_Derivation/MacCready_Speed_to_Fly_Derivation).

# MacCready Interpretation
## Does strict MacCready Speed to Fly work? (MacCready Calculation Assumptions)

Consider the following scenario. A pilot is flying in a competition or on a cross country flight, and they just topped out a climb. Halfway up the climb, their vario peaked at 4 m/s. The pilot remembers reading about MacCready, so they point it straight down course line into a blue hole and dial into MC 4.

What will happen? If they're persistent, they will fly the optimal MacCready speed to fly straight into the ground. 

In building a better understanding of the MacCready speed to fly calculation, one must first examine the assumptions that go into the calculation:

1. The location of the next thermal is known
2. The strength of the next thermal is known
3. The pilot will find and center the next thermal immediately
4. Thermals set up along course-line
5. Thermal strength does not change with altitude

Anyone who has tried to do a thermal cross-country flight on an unpowered aircraft will know that these assumptions all fall apart. Many folks look at MacCready speed to fly and discard it completely because of this. Others, such as [Reichmann](https://www.cumulus-soaring.com/store/cross-country-soaring-free) or [Cochrane](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/581f5f9129687f6b1d73b1e8/t/58c39a0320099e3e84c4dd3e/1489213957260/FlyingFaster.pdf), have expanded out MacCready speed to fly theory to address some of the assumptions.

However, the true value in MacCready's analysis work is not just to tell you specifically how fast to fly. Instead, MC number can be used as a broad tool for decision making in unpowered flight.
## MacCready number as a tool

MacCready speed to fly defines a fixed relationship between speed and altitude. At first look, this is "How much can one trade altitude for speed on glide" or "How much should one degrade their glide ratio to go faster?"

However, this relationship also works the other way. Given the fixed relationship between altitude and speed, MacCready speed to fly theory defines, not just how to trade altitude for speed, but also *how to trade speed for altitude*.

The first clear example of this is on glide between thermals. If a pilot is flying at MC 2m/s, and they come across a 3m/s climb, this pilot should obviously take the climb. Said another way, gaining 3 meters per second is worth more than the loss in time of stopping progress down course line. Conversely, if a pilot flying at MC 2m/s comes across a climb that is only 1m/s, they shouldn't take it. This is because gaining 1 meter per second is worth less than the time loss it incurs. 

By setting a MacCready value, one is then not just setting a speed to fly, but is *defining the relationship between time (speed) and altitude.* 
## Using MacCready number to reason about trades of time to altitude

In sailplanes, pilots install rings around their airspeed indicator that can adjusted to a desired MC numbed, yielding the corresponding speed to fly. It's not only the speed that good pilots look at, but also the MC number. Since this number defines the relationship between speed and altitude, it can be used to make decisions in cross country or competition flight. 

Of course, the first decision the MacCready number informs is how fast to fly on glide. This is a direct trade of altitude for time down courseline. 

As discussed above, the next decision this can directly inform is what climbs to take, and which to leave. If one is flying at a MacCready value of 2 m/s, one should take all climbs above 2 m/s and discard climbs below 2 m/s. This should be applied while in climbs as well; thermals often decrease in energy near the top, so they should be left when their strength drops below a pilot's MC setting.

A third decision MC number informs is what direction to fly. Consider a pilot at the top of a climb, who has two options: straight along course-line, or on a diversion that takes them along a mountain ridge, above a large number of thermal triggers. 

* Option 1: Course-line. 300s to fly.
* Option 2: Diversion, mountain ridge. 400s to fly, 250m altitude gain on option 1.

If the pilot is flying at MC 2m/s, then the 100s diversion is worth 250/2 = 125s in time gain, making option 2 worth it. If the pilot is flying at MC 3m/s, then the diversion is worth 250/3 = 83s in time gain, which is not worth the 100s cost.

When flying at lower MC numbers, large deviations are very valuable. Conversely, when flying at high MC numbers, deviations must return much higher altitude gains to be worth their time penalty. 
## Example MC number "Flight Modes" for a High-B paraglider

### MC < 0.5
* Speed to fly: Trim speed or 1/3 speedbar (adjust for wind/sink)
* Climbs: Take anything, at any altitude, all the way to the top
* Course Deviations: Go in any direction to try to find a climb

### MC 1
* Speed to fly: 1/3 speedbar(adjust for wind/sink). Slow down in any lift.
* Climbs: Take anything above 1 m/s, leave when the climb rate drops decently below 1 m/s. 
* Course Deviations: Large course line deviations up to 90 degrees are likely valuable.

### MC 3
* Speed to fly: 2/3 speedbar or full bar (adjust for wind/sink). Slow down for any climb above 1 m/s 
* Climbs: Take anything above 3 m/s, leave when the climb drops below 3 m/s.
* Course Deviations: Smaller course line deviations up to 20 degrees are likely valuable.

## Realistically setting MC number

With the understanding that MC number defines a relationship between time and altitude, the question that follows is: how does one accurately set MC value?

The first piece of information to consider is the true climb rate of moment. MacCready considers everything between stopping glide to leaving the top of the climb as part of the climb, which includes all time spent finding the core, falling out of the side, and faffing around at the top. If a pilot stops gliding, climbs 1000m and starts gliding again after 500s, their true climb rate is 2 m/s, even if they had portions of the climb at 5m/s. This means that true climb rate, and the *maximum MacCready a pilot should set*, is probably less than initially perceived from the readout of the vario in the climb. 

Pilots also need to continually appraise their true climb rate as conditions change throughout the day; true climb rates may begin at 1m/s at the beginning of the day, increase to 3 at 1pm, then fall to 1m/s as high clouds roll in. 

Once true climb rate is assessed, the next information to consider is what regime the pilot would like to be flying in. MC number shouldn't ever be more than the pilot's true climb rate (this just results in lost time and altitude), but it can be purposely degraded. Remember that MC sets the relationship between time and altitude; if one values altitude more than time, MC can be degraded. For example, if a pilot is on a long XC flight traversing remote terrain, dropping the MC number is appropriate to fly more conservatively. Degrading MC is also appropriate for newer pilots still learning where to find thermals. In competition, some pilots chose to begin their final glide into goal at MC 0 no matter what the conditions, to guarantee they will make it. 

Altitude is another factor. John Cochrane discusses this thoroughly in a *[Just a Little Faster Please](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/581f5f9129687f6b1d73b1e8/t/58c39a0320099e3e84c4dd3e/1489213957260/FlyingFaster.pdf)*, which is a great read for anyone interested in the subject more. Cochrane discusses this on a continuous scale; in a follow-up post, I propose thinking about it in binary. To be continued soon...

### Bonus: Gliding in headwind, tailwind, lift and sink

My friend Muuo has written a great post on how flying in moving air masses effect glide ratio and how a pilot can respond with appropriate speed. Check it out here:
