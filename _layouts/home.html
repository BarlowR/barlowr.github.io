I'm Rob, an engineer an aspiring paragliding pilot.

<h3>What you'll find here:</h3>

<p><b>Projects: </b>
    For now, this is mostly write ups from prototypes built for myself and for my small business <a href="https://merlin-gear.com">Merlin Gear</a>. 
</p>
<p><b>Trip Reports: </b>
    Selections of writing of my experiences & misadventures around California and wherever else I end up. 
</p>
<p><b>Thoughts and Notes: </b>
    I greatly admire the writing of essayists like Maria Popova, Hanif Abdurraqib, and many many more. While I can't come close to the writing of those I admire, I do like to occasionally write bits and pieces of things down.
