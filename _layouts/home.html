<h4> Howdy! I'm Rob, an engineer, aspiring paragliding pilot, and lover of the natural world. </h4>

<p>
    I currently work as a software engineer at <a href="https://reliable.co/"> Reliable Robotics</a>, developing Detect and Avoid (DAA) solutions for unmanned aircraft in the national airspace. I compete (or have competed) in the <a href="https://norcalxc.com/"> Northern California Cross Country League </a> and the <a href="https://xredrocks.com/"> xRedRocks</a>. In 2021, I completed thru-hikes of the Pacific Crest Trail and the Long Trail.

<h3>What you'll find here:</h3>

<p><b>Projects: </b>
    For now, this is mostly write ups from outdoor gear prototypes built for myself and for my small business <a href="https://merlin-gear.com">Merlin Gear</a>. 
</p>
<p><b>Trip Reports: </b>
    Selections of writing of my experiences & misadventures around California and wherever else I end up. 
</p>
<p><b>Thoughts and Notes: </b>
    I greatly admire the writing of essayists like Maria Popova, Hanif Abdurraqib, and many many more. While I can't come close to the writing of those I admire, I do like to occasionally write bits and pieces of things down.
